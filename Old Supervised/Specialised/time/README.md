An implementation where the trajectory fed into the network is one with a constant velocity, and covers the entire width of the environment. The idea is to use this to understand how the same network is also able to represent time. Although it is a bit difficult to view (since the activity is constrained to a small strip), one can see place-cell-like and grid-cell-like firing along that strip. The following activity map was observed:
