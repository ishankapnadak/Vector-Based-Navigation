Same as distance_angle_10 but the weight of the sine and cosine component has been increased to 100. The following loss curves were observed:


**Norm Loss**:

**Sine Loss**:

**Cosine Loss**:

The R<sup>2</sup> coefficient for norm, sine, and cosine are as follows:

1. -0.039
2. -0.084
3. -24.8

The performance on the sine and cosine is still bad, and the performance on distance has further deteriorated.
